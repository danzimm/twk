twk

twk is a base directory for mobile substrate tweaks without the use of theos or logos

Why you may ask?

Imagine you want to call the original of a method after a time delay, meaning in a different method all together (the selector your timer is pointed to). Afaik logos does not have any syntax for this

There are also other benefits

Personally I just like more control

But this is not a hit on DHowett, he is a genius and a gentleman, period.

That is all
